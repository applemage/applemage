### Hi there friends, I'm A Person ðŸ‘‹

Alex Person to be precise, my nickname comes from when I was the field-manager of a 300 acre organic apple orchard. Now the 7th generation steward of my family farm I am working my way towards being a competent full-stack javascript developer. I've also spent time studying and working with Python and C++. My greatest aspiration is to help relieve the burdens of farm labor through development.I'm currently working through a tutorial of javascript projects which I will be modifying. [I have been keeping a WordPress blog]( https://aaperson.com/). I am always looking for new opportunities. In addition to ideas for application development my interests vary between a number of technologies:

- drones
- microcontrollers (Arduino)
- PI
- IoT
- Web3.0 decentralized apps
- robotics
